## Hi there :)

### 🙋 I'm James Cook, a Software Engineer specialising in **Front End and Full Stack Web Development**. I am currently working as a freelance developer, but I would love the opportunity to work on something bigger!

## ⚡About Me

🎓 I am a graduate of _BrainStation's London Bootcamp_, where I honed my skills in modern web development technologies. I also have a degree in _English Literature_, meaning I am able to bring strong communication and problem-solving skills to my work, enabling me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams and deliver high-quality solutions.

💻 I have loved my journey as a Software Enigineer so far, learning many different technologies:

**// Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind

**// Back-end:** Node.js, Express, SQL

**// Tools & Technologies:** Git, GitHub, RESTful APIs

**// Other Skills:** Agile Development, UI/UX Design Principles, CyberSecurity Principles

📖 Since the start of 2024, I have also been learning all about **TypeScript and Figma** for a freelance project that I'm working on. I always aim to be learning something new, whether that's new technologies, or deepening the understanding I have of my existing skillset.

🏅 Winner of **British Airways 2023 Hackathon** - working in a team of UI Designers, Data Scientists, and fellow Software Engineers, we came up with the winning solution.

🔒 I have also just completed a **CyberSecurity Course** - this is something I have always been interested in since I began my journey as a Software Engineer, so I am pleased to have now had some formal education on this topic!
